# How to learn basic Artificial Intelligence 

Follow course [CS:188](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS188.1x-4/1T2015/course/) here, best way to strengthen your base for AI.

## Step 1:

Learn following search algortihms. That will help in the various problems such as path planning, 8-puzzle problem and many more.

```

1.1 Depth First search

1.2 Breath First search

1.3 Informed search vs Uninformed search

1.4 Uniform Cost search

1.5 Greedy search

1.6 A* Search

```

## Step 2:

Learn about Constraint satisfaction problem (CSPs). Those problems which have some constraints associated with them.
In those cases, rather than finding optimal solution we try to find a single solution which satisfies all the constraints.

Examples of such problems are :

```
2.1 Timetable or scheduling

2.2 Map colouring

2.3 Finding graphs's chromatic number.

```

## Step 3:

Learn the basics terminologies before moving ahead to train a agent.

```
3.1 What is enviornment ?

3.2 What is agent ?

3.3 What is utility ?

3.4 What is discounting ?

3.5 Exploration vs Exploitation

3.6 What is action ?

```

## Step 4:

Learn MDP (Markov decision process) and Reinforcement Learning. 

This will include many algorithms and famous equations.

```
4.1 Bellman Equation to solve MDP.

4.2 Value iteration

4.3 Policy iteration

4.4 Model Free and Model based Learning.

4.5 Q-Learning

4.6 Approximate Q-learning

```
