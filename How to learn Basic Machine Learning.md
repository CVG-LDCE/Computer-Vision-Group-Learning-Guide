# How to learn Basic Machine Learning

## Step 1:

Follow the Machine Learning introductory tutorial by Andrew Ng from Stanford University.
```
1.1  Learn Regression and Classification [Linear and Logistic Regression]

1.2  Learn Support Vector Machines

1.3  Learn Artificial Neural Networks

1.4  Learn unsupervised learning methods like K-means, DBSCAN and dimensionality reduction methods like PCA and t-SNE
```

## Step 2:
Gather intuition about basic terms in ML by googling around.

Just use:

“Intuition behind …<some random ML term>...”

Do this for at least 30-40 most common terms that you see.

### Developers [Follow below given steps]

## Step 3:
```
3.1  Follow Sklearn, Keras, Pandas tutorials for Python ML development.

3.2  Learn to understand GitHub repositories.
```
## Step 4:

Do some cool projects.

## OR

### Researchers [Follow below given steps]

## Step 3:

Read the research papers behind the learning algorithms

Best places to start:
```
3.1  Gradient Descent and Ascent [Ascent only if you are planning to go into Reinforcement Learning in the future]

3.2  Backpropagation
```
*and few others...*

## Step 4:

Keep reading research papers unless you can understand the most recent ML research papers.
```
4.1  Dropout

4.2  Batch Normalization

4.3  Stochastic Gradient Descent

4.4  Adam Optimizer
```
*and many more...*

## Step 5:

Follow step 3 and 4 from the developer pipeline [Become the complete package ;) ]
