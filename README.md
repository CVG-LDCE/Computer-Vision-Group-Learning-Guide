# Computer-Vision-Group-Learning-Guide
Docs to learn the very basics to be a part of CVG L.D. College of Engineering.

The Computer Vision Group – LDCE, focuses on the research fields of Object detection and Tracking, Person Identification and Re-Identification, Human Face and Gesture analysis, Image Super resolution techniques using Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks, and Applications of Reinforcement Learning.

We’re committed to increasing diversity in the field of computer vision and have worked for last two years to address the under-representation of undergraduates in computing. To this end, Ayesha Gurnani, Vandit Gajjar, Viraj Mavani, and Yash Khandhediya decided to lay the foundations of Computer Vision Group – LDCE, which ultimately focuses on increasing undergraduate participation in Computer Vision and Deep Learning Research.

We have published papers and abstracts on following conferences and workshops as Undergraduate Students.

* Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition  – CVPR 2018, Salt-Lake City, Utah.
* International Conference on Computer Vision – ICCV 2017, Venice, Italy.
* Women in Machine Learning – WiML 2017 collocated with NIPS 2017, Long Beach, California. (Abstract)
* International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering – ICPCSI 2017, Chennai, India.
* National Conference on Advances in Computer Science Engineering & Technology – NCACSET 2017, Ahmedabad, India.
